Third party libraries
=====================

This folder contains the third party libraries used in this application.

The project uses `Jplayer` as the audio player engine.

`id3-tag-reader` contains the audio tags parsers from Jacob Seidelin (for `ID3v1`) and Ant√≥nio Afonso (for `ID3v2`) and Nicolas Garnier who re-wrote the `AAC` tag parser I also modified these to use jquery and `jdataview` instead of `binaryajax` which was lacking CORS support.
